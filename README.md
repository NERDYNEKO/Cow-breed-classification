# Cow-breed-classification
The project aims to automate the identification of cow breeds using image classification techniques.  A dataset of labeled cow breed images is used for training and testing the model.  The CNN model extracts unique visual features like color, texture, and pattern to distinguish between breeds.

ðŸ§¾ **Description**
This dataset consists of over 1214 labeled images of cows . This Cattle Breeds Dataset consists of 5 different breeds [Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Holstein Friesian, Jersey, Red Dane]. The challenge is to develop models that can accurately classify these images into the correct species.

ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**
**Tensorflow** - Used for building and training neural networks and deep learning models
**Numpy**- A Python library for numerical computations.Provides multidimensional arrays (ndarray) and mathematical functions to operate on them.
**matplotlib.pyplot** - Used for data visualization, like plotting graphs.
**Keras**: For simplifying the creation and training of neural networks.
**os** - Provides functions to interact with the operating system.
